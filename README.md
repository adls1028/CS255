Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The company, DriverPass, requested assistance with creating a website that will be used as an online scheduling system. They were also looking for a system to set up practice exams. DriverPass wanted the system to assist people that were having difficulty in passing their driving test by allowing for practice exams and classes, as well as an online booking system. They wanted all information to be secure, accessible from anywhere via the internet or offline, and allow for users to login and store their data.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I did well in understanding the overall goals of the DriverPass requests. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One thing I would revise would be the diagrams in the System Design Document. I feel that I did not fully understand the use of the diagrams, and would like more time to make them more readable. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I felt like I had a good grasp of all the requests the company when thinking of the system design. It is very important to use the diagrams as well as the design document to keep all of the user's needs in mind while designing everything. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Create diagrams and writeups in your own words of all of the design elements that would need to be put into the software. This will help stay organized and make sure all of the functions requested are included.
